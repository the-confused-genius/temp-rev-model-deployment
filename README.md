# Temperature Revenue model deployment
Building a Machine learning model that predicts the Revenue generated by the ice cream company depending on the weather temperature 

The model is trained using linear Regression using the dataset provided  
The model is then dumped into a pickle file, so that it can be used later by the main file  
The front end html file has also been included in the templates folder 
The model is then deployed on the Heroku platform for functioning  

Given below is the link to the model
